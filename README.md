#### Step 1: Install the Live Blog SDK

Installing the Live Blog SDK is simple if youâ€™re familiar with using external libraries or SDKs. To install the Live Blog SDK using `Gradle`, add the following lines to a `build.gradle` file at the app level.

```groovy
android {
    // ...
    // Keep the following configuration in order to target Java 8.
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.24liveblog:liveblog:1.0.0'
}
````

#### Step 2: Configure ProGuard to shrink code and resources
When you build your APK with minifyEnabled true, add the following line to the module's ProGuard rules file.
```gradle
-keep class com.24liveblog.liveblog.** { *; }
```

#### Step 3: Start SDK
To initialize the sdk it is necessary to add the LiveBlog in the xml:

```xml
<com.liveblog24.sdk.LiveBlog 
        android:id="@+id/live_blog"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

And start the event watcher by passing the following parameters:
```Java
LiveBlog liveBlog = findViewById(R.id.live_blog);
liveBlog.setEvent(EVENT_ID);
```

*  `EVENT_ID`: Live blog event identifier

# Help
We use [GitHub Issues][1] as our bug and feature tracker both for code and for other aspects of the library (documentation, the wiki, etc.).  
Labels on issues are managed by contributors, you don't have to worry about them. Here's a list of what they mean:

 * **bug**: feature that should work, but doesn't
 * **enhancement**: minor tweak/addition to existing behavior
 * **feature**: new behavior, bigger than enhancement, it gives more bang
 * **question**: no need to modify sdk to fix the issue, usually a usage problem
 * **duplicate**: there's another issue which already covers/tracks this
 * **wontfix**: working as intended, or won't be fixed due to compatibility or other reasons
 * **non-library**: issue is not in the core library code, but rather in documentation, samples, build process, releases
